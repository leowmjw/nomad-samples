## Consul
The consul folder contains example on running linkerd with a local consul agent `consul agent -dev`

## Docker-compose

Consul will be started with the other containers, coupled, probably not a good choice.


### Conclusion

You can use linkerd for load balancing, but the ip ports cannot be dynamic?


## TODO
How to create a proper architecture with linkerd?
